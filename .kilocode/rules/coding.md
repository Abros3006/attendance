# Coding Standards Rule

## Overview
This rule outlines the technology stack and coding standards for the attendance system project to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies:

- **Framework**: TanStack Start
- **Database**: Convex
- **Authentication**: WorkOS
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Key Practices
- All code must be written in TypeScript to leverage type safety.
- Follow TanStack Start conventions for routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering.
- Use Convex for database operations, ensuring queries and mutations are properly defined.
- Integrate WorkOS for authentication, handling user sessions and roles appropriately.
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper naming conventions and documentation.

## Constraints
- No use of other frameworks or databases unless explicitly approved.
- All new features must integrate seamlessly with the specified tech stack.
- Code must pass linting and type checking before commits.

This rule ensures the codebase adheres to the chosen technologies and best practices for efficient development.
